# Asexual Awareness Trivia
### A JavaScript game for Asexual Awareness Week


## Technologies used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript
*   jQuery

Not wanting to make the same generic trivia game as an exercise and realizing it was Asexual Awareness Week when I worked on this project, I made a game to raise some awareness of a marginalized sexuality. 

## To use:

* Click [here](https://carmelvineyard.github.io/TriviaGame/) to navigate to the game.
* The game is timed and the timer starts when the page loads.
* Click an answer for each question...
* Then click the Done button to see your score and various reference sources.
* Hover over a question to see what the correct answer was.

## Future development possibilities:

* This already functions similarly to handlebars.js and could be converted pretty easily. React is a possiblity but also perhaps overkill.
* Making the reference/ resource links a different color than the answers
* Perhaps toning down the animations a bit.
* Adding a reset button
* Either making the timer start when the user clicks something or eliminating it entirely.
